# Overview

This repository has code examples to walkthrough some simple programming tutorials.

## Node.js Server

First, install Node.js Long Term Support version from the [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en) website.

Quicklink for Mac: [v12.18.1](https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.18.1/node-v12.18.1.pkg) website.

Note: If using nvm, you can install a new version with `nvm install v12.18.1` and `nvm use v12.18.1`.

Next, review the javascript files at [server-nodejs](./examples/server-nodejs) starting with `01-app.js` and look at commented areas for instructions.

## Python Client

After building the node.js server, look at the client-python examples.
